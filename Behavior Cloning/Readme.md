# Behavior Cloning and learning the jacobian

### BC
In order to guide the robot, we use Behavior Cloning to guide the action selection. 

### Jacobian 

Also, in trivial cases, it is easy to compute the jacobian for IK. However, 
it might very well be a complex function if the robot is more sophisticated. Why not try to learn it ?
