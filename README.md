# Reinforcement Learning for Robotics

This repo contains efforts to accomplish robotic tasks using RL. 

## RL algorithms 

Currently, the repo only has 5 methods: 
* DQN
* REINFORCE
* REINFORCE with baseline
* Actor-Critic
* A2C
* PPO


Currently working on DDPG and CNN + RL implementations.
